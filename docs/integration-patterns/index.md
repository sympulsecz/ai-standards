# Integration Patterns

Connecting AI systems to data sources, APIs, and external tools requires understanding key integration patterns and protocols.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers practical integration approaches for AI systems, focusing on concepts and patterns rather than specific implementations.

## Topics

- **[Model Context Protocol](mcp.md)** - Standard protocol for connecting AI to external systems and data sources
- **[API Patterns](api-patterns.md)** - Reliable patterns for integrating with LLM APIs
- **[RAG](rag.md)** - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for grounding LLM responses in data

## Why Integration Matters

AI systems become significantly more useful when they can access external data, execute actions, and interact with existing systems. Understanding these integration patterns helps you build AI features that are reliable, maintainable, and secure.
