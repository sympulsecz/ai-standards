# AI-Assisted Development

This section covers practical patterns for integrating AI into your daily coding workflow.

## What You'll Learn

- **Effective Prompting**: How to communicate with AI to get useful results
- **Code Review**: Patterns for using AI in the review process
- **Debugging**: Systematic approaches to AI-assisted debugging

## The Core Skill

The fundamental skill in AI-assisted development is **effective communication**. Unlike traditional tools that do exactly what you instruct, AI tools interpret your intent and generate responses. The quality of your input directly affects the quality of output.

## When AI Assistance Helps Most

AI assistance tends to be most valuable when:

- **Boilerplate generation**: Repetitive code that follows clear patterns
- **Translation tasks**: Converting between formats, languages, or styles
- **Exploration**: Understanding unfamiliar code or concepts
- **First drafts**: Getting a starting point to refine
- **Documentation**: Explaining code or generating comments
- **Test generation**: Creating test cases from specifications

## When to Be Cautious

Exercise extra care when:

- **Security-sensitive code**: Authentication, encryption, authorization
- **Complex business logic**: Rules that require deep domain knowledge
- **Performance-critical code**: Where subtle inefficiencies matter
- **Novel problems**: Situations unlike common patterns in training data

!!! warning "Always Verify"
    AI-generated code can contain subtle bugs, security vulnerabilities, or logic errors. Review all generated code as carefully as you would review a colleague's work.

## The Collaboration Mindset

Think of AI as a capable but imperfect collaborator:

| AI Does Well | AI Needs Help |
|--------------|---------------|
| Generating code that follows patterns | Understanding your specific requirements |
| Explaining concepts | Knowing your project's conventions |
| Suggesting approaches | Making final decisions |
| Catching certain errors | Guaranteeing correctness |

The most effective approach is collaborative: use AI to accelerate your work while maintaining your judgment and oversight.
