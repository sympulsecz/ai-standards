# AI Standards

A practical guide to working effectively with AI in software development.

## What This Is

This documentation provides patterns, mental models, and best practices for integrating AI into your development workflow. Whether you're using AI coding assistants, building AI-powered features, or automating processes with AI, you'll find guidance here.

## Guiding Principle

**Concepts over products.** This documentation focuses on transferable knowledge that remains valuable regardless of which specific tools or models you use. Products and tools are mentioned as examples, not as recommendations.
