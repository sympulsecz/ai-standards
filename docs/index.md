# AI Standards

A practical guide to working effectively with AI in software development.

## What This Is

This documentation provides patterns, mental models, and best practices for integrating AI into your development workflow. Whether you're using AI coding assistants, building AI-powered features, or automating processes with AI, you'll find guidance here.

## Guiding Principle

**Concepts over products.** This documentation focuses on transferable knowledge that remains valuable regardless of which specific tools or models you use. Products and tools are mentioned as examples, not as recommendations.

## Quick Navigation

## Find Your Path

Different roles need different documentation. Pick the path that matches your work:

### Using AI Coding Tools Daily

**You're using**: Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or similar tools

**Your path**:

1. Start with [Getting Started](getting-started/key-concepts.md) to understand how these tools actually work
2. Move to [AI-Assisted Development](ai-assisted-development/index.md) for daily coding patterns
3. Check [Automation](automation/index.md) to enhance your workflow with testing and CI/CD

**Why this matters**: Understanding how AI tools work helps you debug issues, write better prompts, and know when to trust (or question) suggestions.

### Building AI Features into Applications

**You're building**: AI-powered features for your applications, chatbots, or autonomous systems

**Your path**:

1. Start with [Getting Started](getting-started/key-concepts.md) for foundational concepts
2. Review [Security](security/index.md) to understand risks when serving customers
3. Explore [Agents](agents/index.md) for architectures, API patterns, and RAG systems
4. Check [Automation](automation/index.md) for testing AI-powered features

**Why this matters**: Building reliable AI applications requires understanding safety guardrails, data handling, and failure modes.

### Automating Development Workflows

**You're implementing**: AI in CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, or code review processes

**Your path**:

1. Start with [Getting Started](getting-started/key-concepts.md) for core concepts
2. Jump to [Automation](automation/index.md) for testing, CI/CD, and MCP integration
3. Optionally explore [Agents](agents/index.md) if building custom automation

**Why this matters**: AI automation can accelerate workflows but needs proper integration to avoid disrupting existing processes.

### Quick Reference

**Need a specific term?** Use the [Glossary](reference/glossary.md)

**Not sure where to start?** Begin with [Getting Started](getting-started/key-concepts.md) - it's useful for everyone.
