# Glossary

A reference of AI and machine learning terminology used throughout this documentation.

## A

**Agent**
: An AI system that can take actions, use tools, and work toward goals autonomously. Unlike simple chatbots, agents can execute multi-step tasks and interact with external systems.

**Alignment**
: The practice of ensuring AI systems behave according to human intentions and values. An aligned AI does what you want, not just what you literally asked.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
: A way for programs to communicate with AI services. You send requests (prompts) and receive responses (completions).

## B

**Batch Processing**
: Processing multiple requests together rather than one at a time. Often more cost-effective for non-time-sensitive workloads.

## C

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**
: A prompting technique where the AI is asked to show its reasoning step-by-step, often improving accuracy on complex tasks.

**Chunking**
: Splitting documents into smaller pieces for processing or retrieval. Important in RAG systems where context windows are limited.

**Completion**
: The text generated by an AI model in response to a prompt. Also called a "response" or "output."

**Context Window**
: The maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that a model can process at once. Includes both input and output.

**Conversation History**
: The record of previous messages in a chat interaction. Models use this to maintain coherent multi-turn conversations.

## E

**Embedding**
: A numerical representation of text (or other data) as a vector. Embeddings capture semantic meaning, allowing similarity comparisons.

**Evaluation (Evals)**
: The process of measuring AI system quality. Includes metrics, test sets, and benchmarks.

## F

**Few-Shot Learning**
: Providing examples in the prompt to guide the model's output format or behavior. "Few-shot" = a few examples; "zero-shot" = no examples.

**Fine-Tuning**
: Training a pre-trained model on additional data to specialize it for specific tasks or domains.

**Function Calling**
: A capability where the model can request to call predefined functions, enabling it to take actions or retrieve information.

## G

**Grounding**
: Connecting AI outputs to factual information or source documents. RAG is a grounding technique.

**Guardrails**
: Constraints and safety measures that limit AI behavior. Includes input filters, output validation, and action restrictions.

## H

**Hallucination**
: When an AI generates plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information. A significant challenge in AI reliability.

**Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**
: System design where humans review, approve, or correct AI outputs before they take effect.

## I

**Inference**
: The process of generating outputs from a trained model. When you call an AI API, you're running inference.

**Instruction Following**
: A model's ability to follow directions given in the prompt. Modern models are specifically trained for this capability.

## J

**Jailbreaking**
: Attempts to bypass an AI model's safety guidelines or restrictions, often through creative prompting.

## L

**Latency**
: The time between sending a request and receiving a response. Includes network time and model processing time.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**
: AI models trained on large amounts of text that can understand and generate human language.

## M

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
: An open protocol for connecting AI systems to external data sources and tools in a standardized way.

**Model**
: The trained AI system that processes inputs and generates outputs. Different models have different capabilities and characteristics.

**Multi-Modal**
: Models that can process multiple types of input (text, images, audio) rather than just text.

## P

**Parameter**
: In AI models, parameters are the learned values that determine model behavior. More parameters generally means more capability (and cost).

**Prompt**
: The input text you send to an AI model. Includes instructions, context, and any examples.

**Prompt Engineering**
: The practice of crafting effective prompts to get desired outputs from AI models.

**Prompt Injection**
: A security vulnerability where malicious inputs manipulate AI behavior by overriding original instructions.

## R

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
: A technique that enhances AI responses by first retrieving relevant information and including it in the prompt.

**Rate Limit**
: Restrictions on how many requests you can make to an API in a given time period.

**ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)**
: An agent architecture pattern where the AI alternates between reasoning about what to do and taking actions.

**Retrieval**
: Finding relevant information from a dataset or knowledge base, typically using semantic search.

## S

**Semantic Search**
: Search based on meaning rather than exact keyword matching. Uses embeddings to find conceptually similar content.

**Streaming**
: Receiving AI responses token-by-token as they're generated, rather than waiting for the complete response.

**Structured Output**
: Constraining AI outputs to specific formats (like JSON) for reliable parsing.

**System Prompt**
: Instructions that set the AI's behavior for an entire conversation. Defines role, constraints, and style.

## T

**Temperature**
: A parameter controlling randomness in AI outputs. Lower temperature = more deterministic; higher temperature = more varied/creative.

**Token**
: The basic unit of text processing for language models. Roughly corresponds to parts of words (typically 3-4 characters in English).

**Tool Use**
: The capability for AI to invoke external functions or APIs to accomplish tasks beyond text generation.

**Training**
: The process of creating an AI model by exposing it to large amounts of data.

## V

**Vector Database**
: A database optimized for storing and searching embeddings (vectors). Essential for RAG implementations.

**Vector**
: A list of numbers representing text or other data. In AI, vectors (embeddings) capture semantic meaning.

## Z

**Zero-Shot**
: Prompting a model to perform a task without providing examples. The model relies on its training and instructions only.
