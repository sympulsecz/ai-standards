# Getting Started

This section provides the foundation for understanding and working with AI in software development.

## What You'll Learn

- **Key Concepts**: The mental models and terminology that underpin all AI-assisted work
- **Tool Setup**: How to think about setting up an AI-assisted development environment

## Why Start Here

AI tools are evolving rapidly, but the underlying concepts remain stable. Understanding *how* these systems work—not just *what buttons to press*—lets you:

- Adapt quickly when tools change
- Debug issues effectively
- Make informed decisions about when and how to use AI
- Get better results from any AI system

## The Big Picture

Working with AI in development involves understanding a few key dynamics:

### 1. Context is Everything

AI systems work by processing context (your code, your instructions, relevant information) and generating responses. The quality of outputs depends heavily on the quality and relevance of the context you provide.

### 2. AI as a Collaborative Tool

Think of AI as a knowledgeable but imperfect collaborator. It can:

- Generate code quickly based on descriptions
- Explain complex concepts
- Suggest approaches to problems
- Catch certain types of errors

It cannot:

- Understand your business requirements implicitly
- Guarantee correctness
- Replace careful review and testing
- Know what happened after its training data cutoff

### 3. Iterative Refinement

Working with AI is often iterative. Initial outputs may need refinement, and the ability to guide the AI toward better results is a learnable skill.

1. Start with [Key Concepts](key-concepts.md) to build your foundational vocabulary
2. Then explore [Tool Setup](tool-setup.md) for environment considerations
